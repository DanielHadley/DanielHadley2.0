title: The Top Urban Planning Articles of 2014
visible: 1
---

For my job, I read a lot of articles on urban policy and planning. I believe that the best policies are usually borrowed from other cities rather than fabricated from nothing. In that spirit, I even borrowed from other top ten lists to create this post. I like to think that my list is more comprehensive than some of the others since I have no incentive to link to my own content. *Caveat emptor*: I use the term planning loosely. Some of these are more inspirational than germane.

[This](http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/08/18/reshaping-new-york/) multimedia feature about Mayor Bloomberg's legacy is still my favorite planning related article (if you can call it that) of all time. But overall, 2013 was a good year.
