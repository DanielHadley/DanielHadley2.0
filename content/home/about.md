# Biography

I am the Chief Data Scientist at the [Sorenson Impact Center](http://eccles.utah.edu/sorenson-impact-center/), an applied academic institution that is part of the University of Utahâ€™s Business School. My job is to help governments, non-profits, and philanthropists use data to better address difficult social problems. (*DISCLAIMER: I don't speak for the Center or any of its affiliates on this blog. These are my opinions.*)

Previously, I served as the Chief of Staff and Chief Data Scientist to Mayor Joe Curtatone of [Somerville, Massachusetts](http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/articles/2006/05/14/the_model_city/), and as an Innovations in American Government Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School.
