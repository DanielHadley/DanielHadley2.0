<p>We recently wanted to brand several of our plots for publication in the local press. I looked around and found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12463691/inserting-an-image-to-ggplot-outside-the-chart-area">couple</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41574732/how-to-add-logo-on-ggplot2-footer">suggestions</a> on how to add images to plots, but nothing that seemed modular or customizable. My colleague reccomended the relatively new <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html">Magick package</a>, which provided all of the functionality I needed (plus a lot more). Here is a simple example along with the code to replicate it:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/images/Cars.png" />

</div>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(magick)
library(here) # For making the script run without a wd
library(magrittr) # For piping the logo

# Make a simple plot and save it
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  ggtitle(&quot;Cars&quot;) +
  ggsave(filename = paste0(here(&quot;/&quot;), last_plot()$labels$title, &quot;.png&quot;),
         width = 5, height = 4, dpi = 300)

# Call back the plot
plot &lt;- image_read(paste0(here(&quot;/&quot;), &quot;Cars.png&quot;))
# And bring in a logo
logo_raw &lt;- image_read(&quot;http://hexb.in/hexagons/ggplot2.png&quot;) 

# Scale down the logo and give it a border and annotation
# This is the cool part because you can do a lot to the image/logo before adding it
logo &lt;- logo_raw %&gt;%
  image_scale(&quot;100&quot;) %&gt;% 
  image_background(&quot;grey&quot;, flatten = TRUE) %&gt;%
  image_border(&quot;grey&quot;, &quot;600x10&quot;) %&gt;%
  image_annotate(&quot;Powered By R&quot;, color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 30, 
                 location = &quot;+10+50&quot;, gravity = &quot;northeast&quot;)

# Stack them on top of each other
final_plot &lt;- image_append(image_scale(c(plot, logo), &quot;500&quot;), stack = TRUE)
# And overwrite the plot without a logo
image_write(final_plot, paste0(here(&quot;/&quot;), last_plot()$labels$title, &quot;.png&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>You can see that this creates a logo centered on a grey background with an annotation originating in the northwest of the band. I wanted to put our logo on the bottom right, 538 style, so I added some superfulous canvas on the right of the png and then croped it to fit our plots with Magick. The point is, Magick is highly customizable and opens up a lot of options that were previously closed to all but the undaunted photoshoppers. Want Vincent Vega to point at your x-axis? Go for it! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go home and have a heart attack.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<pre class="r"><code># Now call back the plot
background &lt;- image_read(paste0(here(&quot;/&quot;), &quot;Cars.png&quot;))
# And bring in a logo
logo_raw &lt;- image_read(&quot;https://i.imgur.com/e1IneGq.jpg&quot;) 

frames &lt;- lapply(logo_raw, function(frame) {
  image_composite(background, frame, offset = &quot;+70+800&quot;)
})

animation &lt;- image_animate(image_join(frames))


image_write(animation, &quot;~/Cars_Travolta.gif&quot;)</code></pre>
