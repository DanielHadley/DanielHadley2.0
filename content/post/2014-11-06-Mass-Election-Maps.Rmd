Most of the maps I have seen so far color each city or town either red or blue based on the majority outcome. That works fine, for the most part, but I prefer to see the range of voting patterns. These heat maps go from light yellow to dark blue. The scale changes on each one in order to show the full spectrum. I managed to automate their creation in R.  

When you see the maps back to back, definite geographic patterns begin to emerge. If I have time over the weekend, I may go in an analyze the data further. In the meantime, you can see the maps below, and my code [here](https://github.com/DanielHadley/MassElections).
