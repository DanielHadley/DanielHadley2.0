<p>While planning a holiday gift exchange this week, my wife casually challenged me with a sort of tricky probability puzzle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sara and I were talking today and realized that we were off by one on the rotation because last year we went sledding instead of buying gifts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It should actually be: * Sara gives to Jonny * Jimmy gives to Thurop * Amy gives to Lisa * Jonny gives to Sara * Thurop gives to Jimmy * Lisa gives to Amy</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So everyone is giving to the same person that is giving to them. How often will this phenomenon happen? Dan, give us a statistical analysis ASAP!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: they do a rotation, but we will pretend it’s random. Also, names <em>not</em> changed for privacy. I actually have a brother-in-law named Thurop, which is pretty cool.)</p>
<p>I fumbled around with permutations for a while before reading that situations like these are actually <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Derangement.html">derangements</a> - permutations of sets where no element appears in its original position. In the case of a six sibling gift exchange, there are 265 derangements. So now we have the denominator.</p>
<p>The question is, of these derangements (I will never get tired of using that word, now that I know it), how many contain combinations where the siblings are mirrored, where each is assigned to the same person? To solve the puzzle, my friend Andrew and I took a three phase approach that we often use:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I try analytically and fail</li>
<li>Andrew succeeds</li>
<li>I confirm his answer with brute-force programming</li>
</ol>
<p>Andrew wrote, “I think the answer is 15/265. The denominator is a derangement, which are confusing as hell, but it is a type of permutation that is calculated: n! * Sum i = 0 -&gt; n of ((-i)^n)/i!. The numerator I’m less sure about.I just counted the total ways that the matches would be mirrored. For person 1 and 6 to be matched there are 3 possibilities, and then there are 5 different people 1 could be matched with, so 5*3.&quot;</p>
<p>The combinations with person 1, aka Sara, and person 6, aka Lisa, look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>[(1,6)(2,5)(3,4)]</li>
<li>[(1,6)(2,4)(3,5)]</li>
<li>[(1,6)(2,3)(4,5)]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then repeat that chain with siblings 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>To confirm, I started with all derangements and wrote a nested for-loop that looked for cases where the siblings are mirrored. The answer: 15/265, or approximately 5% of the time the gift exchange will work out the way it did this year. It’s another festivus miracle!!</p>
