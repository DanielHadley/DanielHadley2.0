<p>The confetti has barely settled on the Golden State Warriors’ victory parade, and there are already people saying that the comparison is over: Michael Jordan is better than LeBron James at basketball. LeBron cannot be considered the Greatest Of All Time. Jordan left with six rings, while LeBron has only three.</p>
<p>My own feeling is that when the stats are this close, there is no objective way to pick a GOAT. We have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model#The_fundamental_problem_of_causal_inference">missing data problem</a>: it’s impossible to see Jordan play on the 2005 Cavs, or watch LeBron go up against a team of space aliens. One must simply pick a side based on favorable stats from below, and then dig in.</p>
<p>Either way, now is an ideal time to compare the two. They have both played 15 seasons in the NBA. These are not advanced statistics - just a few season career totals of basic measures. The first, and arguably most important, is points. Here, Jordan edges out LeBron’s 31,038 with 32,292</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that while they played a similar number of minutes, Michael Jordan took a break for part of his 9th season to <a href="https://www.tarheelblog.com/2018/6/15/17462422/michael-jordans-break-unc-tarheels-baseball-nba-basketball-legacy-questions-goat">play baseball</a>. All of the comparisons have this blip in the data.</p>

<p>Despite the difference in minutes, there is a clear winner in some of the individual categories.</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>LeBron is better. At rebounds, assists, and threes. Jordan wins at scoring, steals, and turnovers. Lebron has 888 blocks and Jordan has 893, so that is a little too close for comfort. Like I said, pick a side and dig in.</p>
