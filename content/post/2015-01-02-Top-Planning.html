<p>For my job, I read a lot of articles on urban policy and planning. I believe that the best policies are usually borrowed from other cities rather than fabricated from nothing. In that spirit, I even borrowed from other top ten lists to create this post. I like to think that my list is more comprehensive than some of the others since I have no incentive to link to my own content. <em>Caveat emptor</em>: I use the term planning loosely. Some of these are more inspirational than germane.</p>
