      <description>Kaggle is a forum for interacting with other data scientists and competing to see who can write code that will best predict features of data. Itâ€™s a way to test your skills at statistics and machine learning, and to do a lot of human learning in the process (sorry, bad pun).
When I entered the contest to categorize crimes that occurred in San Francisco, my initial goal was to do better than random chance.</description>
